---

Friend: Jeez, Mackel. No curse words. None of my orifices being desecrated by your manhood. Maybe you really have changed. I'd respect the effort if I didn't despise you so much or actually believed this isn't just a ploy to mask your fear.  Buuuuut I do. Because I know the truth. I know that deep down in your heart, you're scared. You're terrified of being massacred and having to wait 12 months for another shot. I get it. But I want you to know, Mackel, it's OK. What's about to happen this weekend is not your fault. You've done an admirable job getting this far, but this is where the road ends for you. You're up against a juggernaut. Nothing you can do. I know it'll be difficult not to be disappointed, but you've got years of practice at that now. So this weekend, I want you to really try to appreciate how far your little team has come and then "maturely" accept what you already know in your heart to be true: Your season is over.
andrew.truax: Why is it called trash talk

Friend: Tru you ever been on Boner Lake?
andrew.truax: Haha no but I bet there’s lots of ladies there

Friend: Yeah its wet
andrew.truax: Hot

Friend: We should add a roster spot for team coach. Andrew, you could have Thomas Jones.
andrew.truax: I vote yes.

Friend: The league standings up updated!
andrew.truax: Hey Tim I need you to check Fleaflicker. It says I’m 4-7 that has to be a mistake right? Shouldn’t it be 7-4. My team is way to good to be 4-7

Friend: Jim’s team is pretty great. He’s got 2 wins and no losses. And 5 of his 9 starters are players he got directly from me. Sorry, 6 of 9. 69
andrew.truax: Sex reference

Friend: Attention Jim and Will (who I believe had him every year he was active and injured): 
Former Pro Bowl TE Jordan Reed is retiring, sources say. A 2013 3rd-round pick by the Washington Football Team, Reed emerged as one of the games best receiving TEs before battling injuries. His improbable comeback with #49ers last season allowed him to walk away with no regrets. Sad day for the league. I'm gonna need a minute here.
andrew.truax: There will NEVER be a day as sad as when Thomas Jones retired.

Friend: is chicago a metaphor for death then?
andrew.truax: Yes I believe that may take out wills outsides as well

Friend: Big news, Tru. Thomas Q. Jones (@thomasqjones) is set to appear in True Story (TV miniseries starring Wesley Snipes and Kevin Hart) as Detective Samuels. Jones featured in Netflix's Luke Cage. 
andrew.truax: This is the best news!

Friend: Flutie is on the ambassador block. Looking for a 1st.
andrew.truax: Oh Thomas Jones how I miss you.

Friend: Losing team owners have to write a love poem for one of the winning team's owners that they must recite at the start of the draft...minimum 100 words
andrew.truax: Each member of the losing league must attend and participate as a fan in a WNBA game only time phone can be used is for photo evidence….. and no beer. Or they have to go to a Lions game.

Friend: I hate kickers more than anything in fantasy. Absolute total crapshoot and is pure luck alone. I’d be totally fine with a flex in its place. The real question is is we are waiting three years, can it be a Superflex slot?
andrew.truax: I’m all in for getting rid of kicker is the flex spots consist of a NHL player. Obviously being scored based on his sport

Friend: Andrew, you won by a mile
andrew.truax: Well I guess I’ll have a few more drinks then!  Tell my wife how I dominated!

Friend: Check out the standings this week!
andrew.truax: Hey Tim I need you to check Fleaflicker. It says I’m 4-7 that has to be a mistake right? Shouldn’t it be 7-4. My team is way to good to be 4-7

Friend: You say there will never be a day as sad as when Thomas Jones (TJ) retires, but what if he dies?!
andrew.truax: How dare you bring this up. This man is a legend and the legend will live on forever!

Friend: I don't want Thomas Jones to die. I bring it up because I’m just scared.I just don’t want to be in a world without TJ.
andrew.truax: I know Tim, I’m scared too. I think we all are.

Friend: Did you all get Will's new phone number?
andrew.truax: I like to call my old will numbers and see how the owners of his old number like it. I think I like the new owner better.

Friend: Anyone have any league amendments to recommend?
andrew.truax: Hey guys I heard about this thing called an empire league about a week ago, can’t remember who from but you all should look into seems like cool concept

Friend: I don't condone the trash talk, but I will give you credit, though, at least you’re not bragging about projected scores anymore. You’ve come a long way in the last two weeks.  
andrew.truax: Why it it called trash talk? I just wondered if maybe there was any reason that when somebody insulted his opponent another person though it should be called trash talk

Friend: Andrew, you forgot to set your roster this week!
andrew.truax: Hey my bad on the roster mistakes this week I was going to fix them on and then I got called out on a fire call and forgot to come back to my lineup.
